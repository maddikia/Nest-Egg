# Nest-Egg
**Nest Egg** is a **gamified banking application for kids.** It uses real money in a kid’s custodial bank/investment account. It pairs real financial decisions made by the kid, approved by the parent. It leverages the fact that having “skin in the game” increases engagement. When the kid reaches a legal age, **a real Nest Egg is delivered.**
